# Quiver Project Creator

This is a library for parsing QPC/VPC files. This is part of the [Quiver project](https://github.com/quiverteam).

[Source on Github](https://github.com/quiverteam/qpc-parser){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

These docs are pretty baren so far. I'll add examples on how to use the library a bit
later once it's more fleshed out.
